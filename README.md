# Mediamarkt-Top-100-Site

Hi, welcome in this Github Repository.
It's a repository for a website I (@Neatherblok) made to easily make visible what the top 100 songs of a certain year will be in the Netherlands. I started this site when I just started coding and haven't worked on it since.
The site is currently statically made, which means that no automation is happening. That's also partially the reason why this repository and website haven't been updated since 2018.

Feel free to add pull requests to this branche, my goal in the future is to automate this website so the top 100 playlist of a year is revealed before the official release date.

The way it works is as follows. Every week, there is a top 40 of the songs that has been streamed and played the most in the Netherlands and play that on the radio. The number 1 of that week gets 40 points and the number 40 gets 1 point. At the end of the year all these points gets counted and the first 100 songs with the most points go into the top 100 list.
